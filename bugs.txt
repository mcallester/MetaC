1. macro expansion to a procedure definition does not work.  You have to used "add_form".

2. load can fail on a file where load-region on the whole file succeeds.  The problem involves consecutive cells with no space between them being executed together in the file load but no in the load region.

3. There is a mystrious bug which puts the gdb prompt in the source file cell in an expansion error.  This is a very tough one.  There is a
work-around where one goes to the gdb buffer and evaluates (MC:fixup-gdb).  Quite bad.
