1. macro expansion to a procedure definition does not work.  You have to used "add_form".

2. entries in the symbol_value array are added with a direct set rather than an undo set.  This can cause
a failure to recognize a call to an undefined procedure after restarting a frame.  In the best case this causes
a segment fault.  In the worst case it calls a procedure defined for that index in a frame that was popped.
