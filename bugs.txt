1. macro expansion to a procedure definition does not work.  You have to used "add_form".

2. load can fail on a file where load-region on the whole file
succeeds.  The problem involves consecutive cells with no space
between them being executed together in the file load but no in the
load region.  It seems that the procedure file_forms is failing to
properly separate cells.

3. loading a file then ends inside an open paren hangs. Probably another problem wth file-forms.

4. a compilation error inside an load-region loops through the region repeateing the same error.

*) There is evidence of issues with a procedure name's index in the value table.  It seems that the index
is incremented under repeated undo and redefinition but the procedure version passing the call to the
compiled procedure gets stuck at an older index.  This is not solidly confirmed but should be investigated.

Warts:

5. making program variables pointers.

6. the body of a catch or unwind protect must not contain a return or nonlocal control flow.  Otherwise the catch stack freeptr
may not get reset (very bad). This could be addressed by compiling the body of the catch into a procedure call.
