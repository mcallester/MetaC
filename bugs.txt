1. macro expansion to a procedure definition does not work.  You have to used "add_form".

2. load can fail on a file where load-region on the whole file
succeeds.  The problem involves consecutive cells with no space
between them being executed together in the file load but no in the
load region.  It seems that the procedure file_forms is failing to
properly separate cells.

3. loading a file then ends inside an open paren hangs. Probably another problem wth file-forms.

4. a compilation error inside an load-region loops through the region repeateing the same error.

*) It seems that increasing the index of a symbol (for the index to the symbol_value array) confuses
gdb even when there is no problem with the moving index in the NIDE.  It wouls seem better (for gdb) to
never undo the index property (perhaps requires another field in expptr structures).

Warts:

5. making program variables pointers.

6. the body of a catch or unwind protect must not contain a return or nonlocal control flow.  Otherwise the catch stack freeptr
may not get reset (very bad). This could be addressed by compiling the body of the catch into a procedure call.


If the same procedure is defined twice in the same file with different
signatures then which the file is loaded (as opposed to evaluaty the definitions sequentially)
the signature clash goes undetected.
