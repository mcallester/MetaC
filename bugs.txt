1. macro expansion to a procedure definition does not work.  You have to used "add_form".

2. load can fail on a file where load-region on the whole file succeeds.  The problem involves consecutive cells with no space between them being executed together in the file load but no in the load region.

3. The DLL loader keeps old definitions.  This is now handled for precedure redefinition but still causes problems when a signature is changed
to a different number of arguments or different sizes of arguments even when undoing the original signature definition.
