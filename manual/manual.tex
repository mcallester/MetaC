\begin{abstract}
  MetaC provides a notebook interactive development environment (NIDE) for C programming
  implemented as an emacs editing mode.
  MetaC is capable of incrementally compiling and executing
  C statements and incremental procedure definitions in a persistent C process.
  This is done by compiling and loading dynamic load libraries.

  MetaC extends C with symbolic programming features. More specifically, it provides a C-like universal syntax,
  computed macros, backquote (quasiquote) \cite{backquote}, and pattern-matching.
  The implementation is bootstrapped --- it is implemented in itself.  These C extensions are intended to support the development of high level
  frameworks with notebook interfaces as direct extensions of C.  This is in contrast to scripting-C hybrids such as Matlab, Numpy, TensorFlow or PyTorch.

\section{Introduction and Overview}

\subsection{Installation}

\noindent To install MetaC:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Clone the MetaC repository in a local MetaC directory.
\item Edit the last line of the file mcA.c to give your MetaC directory.
\item Add {\tt (load "$<$MetaC directory$>$/mc.el")} to your .emacs file.
\item Edit the first line of  mc.el to give the path to your gdb executable (the Gnu debugger).
\item Edit the second line of mc.el to give the path to your MetaC directory.
\item From a shell running in your MetaC directory type {\tt make NIDE}.
\item Start or restart Emacs.\footnote{If you load mc.el into a running emacs
MetaC will not be available in buffers created before the load.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Emacs mc-mode}

Emacs buffers visiting files ending in the extension .mc are placed
in mc-mode which is an extension of c-mode.  The mc-mode commands
manipulate ``sections'' and ``cells''.

Figure~\ref{fig:sample-file} shows a simple MetaC file with six cells divided into three sections.

\begin{figure}

{\small
\begin{verbatim}

/** ========================================================================
Hello world
======================================================================== **/

`{hello world}

/** ========================================================================
Procedure defininition
======================================================================== **/

expptr f(expptr exp){return exp;}

f(`a)

/** ========================================================================
Imperative Programming
======================================================================== **/

int x[10];

for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)x[i] = i;

int_exp(x[5])

{int sum = 0; for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)sum += x[i]; return int_exp(sum);}
\end{verbatim}
}
\caption{A sample MetaC file}
\label{fig:sample-file}
\end{figure}
  
\noindent A ``section'' is a region of conceptually related code.  As shown in figure~\ref{fig:sample-file}
sections begin and end with
section delimiter comments o the form

\begin{verbatim}
/** ========================================================================
 <section name>
======================================================================== **/
\end{verbatim}

A cell begins at any nonempty line whose first character is other than white space (space or tab), a close character ')', '\}', or ']', or the equals sign '=' and which is outside of a C comment.
The cell ends at the beginning of the next cell or at the end of the file if no next cell.

The commands of mc-mode are listed in fugure~\ref{fig:mc-commands}.

\begin{figure}
  
\begin{verbatim}
(define-derived-mode mc-mode
  c-mode "mc-mode"
  "Major mode for meta-c"
  (define-key mc-mode-map "\C-xc" 'make-section)
  (define-key mc-mode-map "\C-\M-u" 'MC:beginning-of-sec)
  (define-key mc-mode-map "\C-\M-d" 'MC:end-of-sec)
  
  (define-key mc-mode-map "\C-\M-s" 'MC:start-metac)
  (define-key mc-mode-map "\C-\M-x" 'MC:execute-cell)
  (define-key mc-mode-map "\C-\M-r" 'MC:load-region)
  (define-key mc-mode-map "\C-\M-a" 'MC:beginning-of-cell)
  (define-key mc-mode-map "\C-\M-e" 'MC:end-of-cell)
  (define-key mc-mode-map "\C-\M-c" 'MC:clean-cells)
  (define-key mc-mode-map "\C-\M-g" 'MC:indent-cell)

  (define-key mc-mode-map "\C-x`" 'MC:display-error))
\end{verbatim}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:execution-results} shows the state of the buffer after executing the cells in figure~\ref{fig:sample-file}.

\begin{figure}
 \begin{verbatim}
/** ========================================================================

======================================================================== **/

`{hello world}
/** 1:hello world **/


/** ========================================================================

/** 2:done **/

f(`a)
/** 3:a **/

/** ========================================================================

int x[10];
/** 4:done **/

for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)x[i] = i;
/** 5:done **/

int_exp(x[5])
/** 6:5 **/

{int sum = 0; for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++)sum += x[i]; return int_exp(sum);}
/** 7:45 **/
\end{verbatim}
\caption{The result of executing the cells.  Executing a cell inserts or replaces a comment
  giving the cell execution number (the count of executions since starting or restarting MetaC)
  and the execution result.}
\label{fig:execution-results}
\end{figure}

In C syntax one distinguishes C expressions from C statements.  A C
statement is executed for effect while a C expression is evaluated for
value. A MetaC cell can be either a statement or an expression.  The result of successfully
executing a C statement is simply ``done''.
A expptr is an abstract syntax tree as defined by a ``universal'' grammar.
The procedure {\tt int\_exp} in figures~\ref{fig:sample-file} and \ref{fig:execution-results}
converts an integer to an expptr.  Instances of the type expptr are ``universal'' in the sense that any parenthesis-balanced string
parses as an expptr.  Futhermore, parsing a string and then printing the resulting expression is guaranteed to return the same string.
Hence instance of this type can also be viewed as representations of strings.

If a C statement in a cell executes a {\tt return} outside of any
procedure then that value is returned as the value of the cell.
This is shown in the last cell in figure~\ref{fig:execution-results}. 

\subsection{Definitions of Types and Procedures}

One can also define new data types and procedures in cells.

\begin{verbatim}

typedef struct myexpstruct{
   char * label;
   struct myexpstruct * car;
   struct myexpstruct * cdr;} myexpstruct, *myexp;
/** 7:done **/

myexp mycons(char*s,myexp x,myexp y){
    myexp cell=malloc(sizeof(myexpstruct));
    cell->label=s;
    cell->car=x;
    cell->cdr=y;
    return cell;}
/** 8:done **/

expptr myexp_exp(myexp x){
   if(x==NULL)return string_atom("nil");
   return
    `{${string_atom(x->label)}
      ${myexp_exp(x->car)}
      ${myexp_exp(x->cdr)}};
}
/** 9:done **/

myexp_exp(mycons("foo",mycons("bar",NULL,NULL),NULL))
/** 10:foo bar nil nil nil **/
\end{verbatim}

A cell can redefine a procedure provided that the
signature (argument types and return type) remains the same. Changing a procedure signature
requires clearing the undo frame in which the signature was defined or restarting MetaC if the signature is defined in the base frame.  See section~\ref{sec:undo}.
This restriction ensures
meaningful C type checking in the presence of dynamic linking.

\subsection{The Global Variable Array Restriction}

To facilitate dynamic linking, all global data
variables must be arrays. One can always use single element
arrays to represent non-array variables.  To make this more convenient
we allow single element arrays to be declared with an initial value in a
manner similar to non-array data variables.  For example, we can declare and assign a variable {\tt y}
as follows.

\begin{verbatim}
int y[0] = 2;
/** 10:done **/
\end{verbatim}

MetaC treats {\tt int y[0] = 2;} as equivalent to

\begin{verbatim}
int y[1];
/** 10:done **/

y[0] = 2;
/** 11:done **/
\end{verbatim}

We can continue with

\begin{verbatim}
y[0] += 1;
/** 11:done **/

int_exp(y[0])
/** 12:3 **/
\end{verbatim}

Here assignments to {\tt y[0]} are allowed but assignments to {\tt y} are not --- assignments to array variables
are not allowed in $C$.

\subsection{The Single Symbol Type Restriction}

To simplify the implementation of MetaC all type expressions appearing in procedure signatures and global array declarations must be single symbols.
Arbitrary types can be given single symbol names using {\tt typedef}.

\subsection{Backquote and Universal Syntax}

We now consider backquote and universal syntax in more detail.  Backquote can be used in a manner analogous to string formatting.

\begin{verbatim}
expptr friend[0] = `{Bob Givan};
/** 13:done **/

int height[0] = 6;
/** 14:done **/

`{My friend ${friend[0]} is ${int_exp(height[0])} feet tall.}
/** 15:My friend Bob Givan is 6 feet tall. **/
\end{verbatim}

While universal syntax expressions can be viewed as representations of strings, universal syntax
expressions are actually abstract syntax trees. The tree structure
plays an important role in pattern matching.

\subsection{Pattern Matching}

MetaC provides a pattern matching case construct {\tt ucase} (universal case).
The basic form of the case construct is

\begin{verbatim}
ucase{e;
  <pattern1>:{<body1>};
   ...
  <patternn>:{<bodyn>}}
\end{verbatim}

Variables are marked in patterns by the prefix $\$$.  When a {\tt ucase} is executed the patterns are tried sequentially and stops after the first match.
If no pattern matches the {\tt ucase} generates an execution error.
Execution errors are handled by the gnu debugger gdb and are discussed below.
One can always add a final pattern of {\tt \{$\$$any\}} to provide a default
catch-all case if that is desired.
Repeated variables, such as in the pattern {\tt \{$\$$x + $\$$x\}}, are not supported (and not checked for).
If a variable is repeated it will be matched at its last occurrence under depth-first left to right traversal.
We have the following example.

\begin{verbatim}
int numeralp(expptr x)
    {if(!atomp(x))return 0;
    char*s=atom_string(x);
    for(int i=0;s[i]!='\0';i++){if(s[i]<'0'||s[i]>'9')return 0;}
    return 1;
}
/** <n>:done **/

int value(expptr e)
  {ucase
    {e;
      {$x+$y}:{return value(x)+value(y);};
      {$x*$y}:{return value(x)*value(y);};
      {($x)}:{return value(x);};
      {$z}.(numeralp(z)):{return atoi(atom_string(z));}
    }
  return 0; //this dead code convinces the compiler there is a return value.
  }
/** <n>:done **/
\end{verbatim}

The last clauses of the last procedure uses a condition feature where a pattern can have the
form \{$<$pattern$>$\}.($<$condition$>$)
where $<$condition$>$ is a C expression which must be non-zero in order for the clause to be selected.

\begin{verbatim}
int_exp(value(`{5+2*10}))
/** <n>:25 **/
\end{verbatim}

In many situations the choice of the particular tree structure imposed by the MetaC reader is not important as long as the same conventions are used in both the patterns and the expressions
they are matching.  For example, the expression {\tt a+b+c} will match the pattern
{\tt $\$$x+$\$$y+$\$$z} independent of whether + is left associative or right associative.  But the tree structure does matter in other cases.  The pattern {\tt $\$$x*$\$$y}
will not match the expression {\tt a+b*c} because the reader brackets {\tt a+b*c} as  $\fopen \mathtt{a~+} \fopen \mathtt{b * c} \fclose\fclose$. The pattern {\tt $\$$x*$\$$y} does match {\tt (a+b)*c}.
The variable {\tt $\$$any} is special.  It acts as a wild card and is not bound to a value.


\subsection{Gensym and Macro Definitions}

MetaC supports (unhygenic) computed macros.  Pattern matching and backquote greatly facilitate the writing of computed macros.  Backquote and ucase are both implemented as computed macros in the bootstrapped implementation. As a very simple example we can define a {\tt dolist} macro.

\begin{verbatim}
umacro{dolist($x,$L){$body}}{
   expptr rest=gensym("rest");
   return
    `{for(expptr $rest = $L; cellp($rest); $rest = cdr($rest);){
      expptr $x=car($rest);
      $body}};
}
/** <n>:done **/

macroexpand(`{dolist(item,list){f(item);}})
/** <n>:
for
  (expptr _genrest33=list;
   cellp(_genrest33);
  _genrest33=cdr(_genrest33);
  ){expptr item=car(_genrest33);f(item);} **/
\end{verbatim}

The general form of a macro definition is
\begin{verbatim}
umacro{<pattern>}{<body>}
\end{verbatim}
where instances of {\tt <pattern>} in MetaC code are to be replaced by
the value returned by {\tt <body>} under the variable bindings
determined by the match.  The pattern is restricted so as to have
an identifiable head symbol to which the macro is attached.

The procedure {\tt macroexpand(exptr e)} takes a
universal syntax expression and returns the result of repeatedly
expanding outermost macros until no further macro expansion is
possible.

The macro expansion of the above definition of {\tt dolist}
defines a procedure
to compute the macro expansion and installs that procedure on a macro
property of the symbol {\tt dolist}.  A typical macro pattern
is a symbol followed by one or more parenthesis
expressions in which case the macro is attached to the initial symbol.
The macro can also be attached to a binary connective.
For the macro pattern {\tt \{\$x $.\!>$ \$y\}}.
the macro is attached to the two-character binary connective $.\!>$.

It is sometimes useful to see the result of a single step
of macro expansion. The procedure {\tt macroexpand1(expptr)} returns
the result of a single step of macro expansion on the root of the given argument.

\subsection{Errors and Breakpoints.}

The execution of a cell involves

\begin{enumerate}
  \item reading the expression in the cell into an expptr data structure
  \item macroexpanding the expression,
  \item compiling the resulting C code
  \item executing the compiled code
\end{enumerate}

Errors can occur in any of these steps. If a cell contains unbalanced parentheses, or non-ascii unicode characters, MetaC will print
{\tt "reader error"} as the value of the cell and display an error message (placed in the buffer *MC compilation*).
If an error occurs while macro-expanding the cell expression, MetaC will print {\tt "macro expansion error"}
as the value of the cell and enter the
gdb debugger.  Such an error may be
due to a bug in a user-written macro and gdb can be useful in this case.
Typing the continue command, which can be abbreviated as just {\tt "c"}, will abort the cell execution and return to emacs.
If an error occurs while attempting to compile the macro-expanded cell, emacs will print {\tt "compilation error"} as the value of the cell
and display the compiler errors.  In this case the ``display error'' command "$\backslash$ C x-`" will bring up a C file that was passed to the compiler.
These errors contain the name of the C file passed to the compiler.  Examining this C file is sometimes helpful.

There are two kinds of errors that can occur in the final execution phase.  The first is a ``dynamic check error''.  This is an error caught
by a explicit check in the code such as a {\tt ucase} expression where no pattern matches or a call to the MetaC error function {\tt berror(char *)}.
A dynamic error causes control to be passed to the gdb debugger.  The continue command then return control to the nide and the value of the cell is
printed as ``dynamic-check error''.  It is also possible that execution leads to some other error, typically a segmentation fault.  This also causes
control to be passed to the gdb debugger but the continue command is not applicable in this case.  In this case one can return to emacs by
entering p NIDE() to gdb.

The MetaC procedure {\tt breakpt(char *)} can be used for breakpoints
from which execution can be continued.  When {\tt breakpt} is called
emacs will invoke gdb with no error message printed in emacs but with the string passed to {\tt breakpt} printed in the first line in
the debugger window. The continue command will continue execution from the breakpoint.

MetaC is designed to minimize the risk of memory corruption
when returning to emacs from an error.
See the discussions of unwind protection in sections~\ref{sec:memory} and \ref{sec:undo}.
If there is a concern over memory corruption one can always restart the C process with the command "$\backslash$C-$\backslash$M-s".

\subsection {Printing.} The procedure {\tt mcprint} is like {\tt fprintf} but omitting the file argument. The expression
{\tt mcprint("x = \%s$\backslash$n",s)} will print to the *Messages* buffer in Emacs. The procedure {\tt mcpprint(expptr e)}
will pretty-print the expression $e$ to the *Messages* buffer.  When in the gdb debugger entering {\tt p pp($<$exp$>$)} will
pretty print the given expression.

\subsection{Load Statements.}  A cell in a code file containing {\tt
load($<$filename$>$)} (with no semicolon) will load the cells
of the named file (which should be a string constant) into the persistent C process.  The extension .mc
will be automatically added and should not be explicitly given.

\section{Miscellaneous Features}

\subsection{Interning and Properties}

In MetaC expressions are interned and have property lists.
Interning means that two expressions which have the same tree structure and sequence of leaves are represented by the same data structure with the same memory address.
This is sometimes called ``hash-consing'' and can be expressed in Lisp terminology by saying that ``equal'' implies ``eq''.
Hence we have
\begin{verbatim}
int_exp(`{foo(a)} == `{foo(a)})
/** <n>:1 **/
\end{verbatim}
Interned expressions with properties provide the functionality of dictionary data structures such as C++ hashmaps or Python dictionaries.
Interning also facilitates the implementation of forward chaining inference algorithms --- we do not want to waste time noticing the same
consequence over and over again.  Interned expressions with property lists can also be viewed as a form of no-SQL database.
Interning also allows directed acyclic graphs (dags) to be represented compactly as expressions.  This is very convenient
for the representation of machine-generated justifications (proofs).

The procedure {\tt setprop(expptr exp, expptr prop, void * value)}
sets the given property of the given expression to the given value.
The procedure {\tt getprop(expptr exp, expptr prop, void * default)}
returns the given property of the given value or the default value if
no property value has been assigned.  MetaC also provides the
procedures {\tt setprop\_int(expptr e, expptr p, int n)} and {\tt
  getprop\_int(expptr e, expptr p, int default)}.  It is not difficult
to define polymorphic macros for setting and extracting properties
where the type of the property is passed as an argument.  It is also
not difficult to assign types to particular properties so that the
type argument is not needed in polymorphic property setting and
retrieving.  However, these features are not present in release 1.0.

\subsection{Memory Frames}
\label{sec:memory}

A memory frame is analogous to a stack frame but is only loosely tied
to the C stack.  The macro {\tt in\_memory\_frame($<$statement$>$)}
will execute the given statement inside a new memory frame.  The
procedure {\tt stack\_alloc(int nbytes)} returns a pointer to a block
of the given size allocated from the current memory frame. When {\tt
  in\_memory\_frame($<$statement$>$)} exits the memory-frame free
pointer (or ``stack pointer'') is reset.  This frees all memory
allocated from the frame.  This architecture differs from traditional
stack allocation in that recursive procedures can operate with a
single memory frame and return newly allocated memory as values
without copying.  The allocated storage will not be deallocated until
exit from an enclosing use of {\tt in\_memory\_frame}.  MetaC
pre-allocates the heap (stack space) used for memory frames.  The
deallocation (resetting of the freeptr) is unwind protected --- it
will occur when an error is thrown beyond the frame entry point.  This
avoids a memory leak when returning from an error to emacs.

MetaC clears the base memory frame after every cell execution.
It is therefore important not to be using
stack allocated memory between cell executions.

\subsection{Undo Frames}
\label{sec:undo}
Undo frames are similar to memory frames but with the added feature of undoing effects tied to the frame.
The macro {\tt exp\_from\_undo\_frame($<$expression$>$)} creates a new undo frame and executes the given expression
in the new frame. Memory is allocated from the current undo frame
with {\tt undo\_alloc(int nbytes)}.  Undo assignments to pointer variables are done with
{\tt undo\_set(void *, void *)}.
Undo assignments to integer variables are done with 
{\tt undo\_set\_int(int, int)}.
On exit from an undo frame all memory allocated from that frame is reclaimed by resetting a free pointer
and all locations assigned by {\tt undo\_set} are restored to the values they had before entry to the frame.

In MetaC all expression allocation and property assignments are tied to the current undo frame.
On exit from the undo frame the database represented by expression properties is restored to
the state that existed on frame entry.

The macro {\tt exp\_from\_undo\_frame($<$expression$>$)} computes the value of the given expression in a new undo frame, then pops that undo frame while
copying the computed value into the parent undo frame.  The value must be a universal syntax expression
(an {\tt expptr}). This is used for returning the ``value'' or ``result'' of a large computation while freeing the allocation
and undoing the effects of the computation.
The macro {\tt exp\_from\_undo\_frame($<$expression$>$)} has unwind protection so that the undo frame is popped (with memory deallocated and effects undone)
if an error is thrown in the execution of the expression.
%%
%% is there a way for the user to throw an error other than berror, i.e. not go to gdb?
%%
%% internally there is the procedure throw_error() but this will throw all the way to emacs.
%% we do not currently have general exceptions.
%% 

The procedure {\tt clean\_undo\_frame(expptr e)} is similar to {\tt exp\_from\_undo\_frame} but replaces the current undo frame with a fresh one
into which the given expression is copied.  In this case there is no allocation from the parent frame.
The procedure {\tt clean\_undo\_frame(expptr e)} can be used for garbage collection
as in {\tt (install\_live\_stuff(clean\_undo\_frame(compute\_live\_stuff())))}.
%% 
%% It seems we lack a functionality to leave the current undo frame with an expression.
%% Perhaps this should be called return_from_undo_frame(expptr exp)
%% Or there could just be an optional argument to pop_undo_frame (making it a umacro)
%%
%% this would require an additional notion of ``throw'', or a general exception mechanism, to throw to the
%% nearest enclosing exp_from_undo_frame.  Doable but somewhat nontrivial.  Maybe in a future release.

The procedures {\tt exp\_from\_undo\_frame} and {\tt clean\_undo\_frame} both use expression copying that runs
in time proportional to the dag size of the expression. The dag size can be exponentially smaller than the tree size.

{\tt exp\_from\_undo\_frame} is a macro that expands to a C expression.  Recall that C expressions have values
while C statements do not.  Macros that expand to expressions (with values)
typically expand to compound expressions of the form (\{... $<$var$>$;\}) where the value returned
is the value of the final variable after executing the previous statement.  Compound expressions are a GNU C extension.

The base undo frame is not cleared between evaluations. The base frame is holding properties needed for
the proper functioning of MetaC.
The base frame should not be manually cleared.  It is not difficult to write a collector for collecting the state used by the MetaC system which could then be integrated
into a user-written state collector for garbage collecting the base frame.  However MetaC 1.0 does not support garbage collecting the base undo frame.  One can always
restart the C process.

{\tt restart\_undo\_frame(<n>)} is a procedure that restarts the $n$th undo frame.  The base frame has a conceptual index of -1 and cannot be restarted.
Undo frame 0 is the first restartable frame. When in frame $n$ (possibly $n = -1$), executing {\tt restart\_undo\_frame($n+1$)}
will push an undo frame and leave the system in frame $n+1$.  The pushed undo frame can then act as a ``checkpoint''.
After running many cells and building up additional procedure and variable definitions, re-executing {\tt restart\_undo\_frame($n+1$)}
will remove the procedure and variable definitions, and undo all undo-trailed effects, that were done in undo frame $n+1$ or higher.
This provides an alternative to restarting the kernel when, for example, one wants to change the signature of a procedure.
Calls to {\tt restart\_undo\_frame} can be distributed through a file under development to establish various checkpoints from which one can restart.


\subsection{Bootstrapping and File Expansion}
\label{sec:bootstrap}

MetaC is bootstrapped.  The makefile for MetaC includes the following.
\begin{verbatim}
mcB.c : expandA mcB.mc
	 ./expandA mcB.mc mcB.c
\end{verbatim}
The executable {\tt expandA} is implemented entirely in C but implements the backquote macro.  The executable {\tt expandA}
expands backquote expressions appearing in the input file. The file {\tt mcB.mc} implements {\tt ucase} using backquote
and the excutable expandB expands both backquote expressions and ucase statements.
The makefile also includes.
\begin{verbatim}
mcC.c : expandB mcC.mc
	 ./expandB mcC.mc mcC.c
\end{verbatim}
Here the file {\tt mcC.mc} implements additional macros using both backquote and ucase.  In the MetaC makefile this is continued up to mcE.mc and expandE.
MetaC provides the procedure
{\tt mcexpand(char * f1, char * f2)} which is used in the code for the expand commands.  This procedure macro-expands the
file {\tt f1} and writes the result to file {\tt f2}.  The expansion is done using whatever macros are defined
in the current state --- the expansion uses whatever procedures and operators currently
have macro expansion procedure pointers on their property lists.

The procedure {\tt mcexpand(char * f1, char * f2)} is implemented using the MetaC procedure {\tt file\_expressions(char * f)}.
This procedure takes a file name and returns a list of the expressions contained in the cells of that file.

\subsection{Macro Effects}

%% It might be good to explain when a user might want to know about
%% add_init_form and init_fun.  I guess this is when they are
%% compiling expanded .mc files into .o files and linking?

Macros expansion can have effects.  The macro {\tt umacro} expands to a procedure definition of the macro expansion code but also
generates a statement which installs that procedure pointer in the macro property of the head symbol.  During macro expansion the
MetaC primitive {\tt add\_init\_form(expptr statement)} is called with a statement that installs the procedure pointer on the appropriate property list.
The procedure {\tt add\_init\_form} is provided to the user for use in defining complex macros
requiring this feature.

{\bf In file expansion} the initialization forms generated during macro expansion are incorporated into an initialization procedure.
The declaration {\tt init\_fun(<fname>)} gives the procedure name for an initialization procudure to install the effects.
{\bf In cell execution} the initialization forms generated by macro expansion
are inserted in the C code for cell execution.

\subsection{Macro Preliminary Definitions}

%% Can lambda with free variables be handled? This would seem to
%% require local procedures and not strictly preambles?
%%
%% A Preamble suffices.  The preamble procedure needs to take both the free variable values and the argument values.
%% The macro then expands into the creation of the closure data structure holding the free variable values.
%% The hard part is determining the free variables.

Macro expansion can also generate preliminary definitions.  It is
possible to implement syntactic closures (lambda) as a macro.  A
closure consists of a procedure pointer together with values for the
free variables of the lambda expression.  The lambda macro
must first create the procedure that executes the body of the lambda
expression and then incorporate that procedure pointer into the
expansion of the lambda macro.  The construction of the procedure
definition is a ``preamble'' to the macro expansion.  MetaC provides
the primitive {\tt add\_preamble(expptr definition)} for creating
preambles during macro expansion.  In file expansion these preamble
definitions are inserted into the output file before the expression
generated by the macro.  When executing a cell these preamble
definitions are installed along with the expression created by the
macro.  MetaC 1.0 supports preambles but does not provide a macro for
lambda expressions.

\subsection{List Operations}

The macro {\tt deflists(<type>)} creates operations on lists of the given type.  For example

\medskip
\centerline{\tt deflists(expptr)}

expands to

\begin{verbatim}
typedef struct expptr_list_struct{
    expptr first;
    struct expptr_list_struct * rest;}expptr_list_struct, * expptr_list;

expptr_list expptr_cons(expptr x, expptr_list y){
   expptr_list cell = (expptr_list) undo_alloc(sizeof(expptr_list_struct));
   ...}

expptr_list expptr_append(expptr_list x, expptr_list y){...}

expptr exptr_nth(expptr_list x, int n){...}

int expptr_member(expptr x, expptr_list y){...}

umacro{push_expptr($x,$y)}{return `{undo_set($y,expptr_cons($x,$y))}}

umacro{exptr_iter($x,$y){$body}}{...} //executes body for each x in y

umacro(expptr_listfun($args)}{...} //creates a list of any number of arguments
\end{verbatim}

The macro {\tt pushprop(x, getprop(y,prop))} pushes x onto the list stored in the given property of expptr y.  This cannot be easily type
checked and it is assumed that the given property is a list of pointers.

The list operations are predefined for {\tt expptr} and {\tt voidptr} and automatically defined for each class declared in the object system.


\subsection{Throw, Catch, and Exceptions}

The following throw and catch macros are contained directly in the MetaC source code.

\begin{verbatim}
#define CATCH_DIM 1000
int *catch_freeptr;

jmp_buf *catch_stack;
int *error_flg;

#define throw_check() \
  {if(catch_freeptr[0] == 0) \
    {fprintf(stderr,"\n uncaught throw --- C process fatal\n"); cbreak(); exit(1);}}

#define catch_check() \
   {if(catch_freeptr[0] == CATCH_DIM){berror("catch stack exhausted");}}

#define throw_error() \
   {throw_check(); error_flg[0]=1; longjmp(catch_stack[catch_freeptr[0]-1], 1);}

#define catch_error(body) \
 {catch_check(); error_flg[0]=0;\
  if(setjmp(catch_stack[catch_freeptr[0]++]) == 0)\
   {body; catch_freeptr[0]--;\
    } else \
     {catch_freeptr[0]--;\
      if(!error_flg[0])\
        {fprintf(stderr, "uncaught throw caught as error\n"); cbreak();}}}

#define throw() \
   {throw_check(); error_flg[0]=0; longjmp(catch_stack[catch_freeptr[0]-1], 1);}
  
#define continue_throw() \
   {throw_check(); longjmp(catch_stack[catch_freeptr[0]-1], 1);}

#define catch(body) {catch_check(); if(setjmp(catch_stack[catch_freeptr[0]++]) == 0)\
  {body; catch_freeptr[0]--;} else{catch_freeptr[0]--; if(error_flg[0])continue_throw();}}

#define unwind_protect(body, cleanup) \
  {catch_check(); if(setjmp(catch_stack[catch_freeptr[0]++]) == 0)\
  {body; catch_freeptr[0]--;} else { catch_freeptr[0]--; cleanup; continue_throw();}}
\end{verbatim}

The following extends the above to general exceptions.

\begin{verbatim}
expptr exception[0] = NULL;

expptr exception_value[0];

umacro{catch_excep{$exception}{$body}{$handler}}{
  return `{
    catch({$body})
      if(exception[0]){
	if(exception[0] == `$exception){
	  exception[0] = NULL;
	  $handler}
	else continue_throw();}};
}

umacro{throw_excep{$exception;$value}}{
  return `{
    expcetion[0] = `{$exception};
    exception_value[0] = $value;
    throw();};
}
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{Object-Oriented Programming}

MetaC provides an object system where the collection of classes must be tree structured (no multiple inheritance) with
a built-in root class called {\tt object}. Classes are declared with the macro {\tt defclass}.  The class declaration

\medskip
\centerline{\tt defclass\{foo\{object; expptr x;\}\}}

generates the structure definition

{\tt
\begin{verbatim}
 typedef struct foo_struct{
  int class_index;
  expptr x;} foo_struct, *foo;
\end{verbatim}
}
Given this declaration, the declaration

\medskip
\centerline{\tt defclass\{bar\{foo; foo y; bar z;\}\}}

generates the structure definition
{\tt
\begin{verbatim}
typedef struct bar_struct{
  int class_index;
  expptr x;
  foo y;
  bar_struct * z;} bar_struct, *bar;
\end{verbatim}
}

The general form is similar to a structure definition in C except that the parent class is named
and the class being defined can be used naively as the type of an instance variable.
Each class inherits instance variables from its parent and an instance of a class can be safely cast as an instance of any parent class.

Instances of any class {\tt foo} in the class hierarchy can be allocated with the macro call {\tt new(foo)}.  Objects are initialized
with their class index but no other instance variables are initialized. Instances are allocated from undo memory
so that the allocation is undone when the current undo frame is cleared or popped.

Methods are declared with {\tt defmethod}.  For example we have

\medskip
\centerline{\tt defmethod\{expptr g(foo self; expptr x;)\{return x;\}\}}

which creates a foo-specific definition of g

\medskip
\centerline{\tt expptr g\_52(foo self\_37, expptr x);.}

Each method is associated with a dispatch table indexed by class.  This method definition installs this procedure pointer
in the method table for $g$ at the class index for the class {\tt foo} and also at the class indeces for the subclasses of the class {\tt foo}.
Once a method is defined at a class it cannot be redefined at any parent or any child of that class.

The above method definition also defines {\tt g} as a macro such that {\tt g(x,y)} expands to inline code
which extracts the class index from {\tt x} and extracts the procedure pointer from the method table for $g$
and calls that procedure on $x$ and $y$ with $x$ cast as {\tt foo}.  Here the class {\tt foo} can be a proper
superclass of the actual class of $x$.  The overhead of a method call as opposed to an ordinary procedure call is a single one-dimensional
array reference.  There is currently a limit of 100 classes so that the method tables are small.

The system maintains the invariant that methods are inherited from super-classes as new methods and classes are incrementally defined.
In particular, when a new class {\tt foo} is defined
the method tables for methods defined on parent classes of ${\tt foo}$ must be updated to include a procedure pointer entry for the subclass ${\tt foo}$.

Within the body of a method instance variables are defined as free variables.
However, the current implementation does not support assignments {\tt x=v} for instance variable {\tt x} within methods --- do {\tt self->x = v;} instead
and reember to use {\tt setf-undo} if you want effects undone (initialization does not have to be undone as the memory is reclaimed in any case).

List operations are automatically created for each class.

\section{Universal Syntax}

It is not obvious how to implement light weight expression quotation and expression pattern matching for C expressions.  The syntax of C is complex.
We bypass this complexity by introducing a syntax with the following three ``universal'' properties.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Universal syntax trees are semantics-free.  They are simply trees viewed as representations of character strings.

\item The universal syntax reader can read any parenthesis-balanced character string.
  Here parenthesis-balanced means that every open parenthesis, brace or bracket has a matching closing character and that string quotations
  are properly closed.
  
\item The printer inverts the reader. If we read a string $s$ into a universal syntax expression
  $e$ and then print $e$ back into a string $s'$ we have that $s$ and $s'$ are equivalent in a strong sense.  Here we want
  $s$ and $s'$ to be ``whitespace equivalent'' so as to be treated equivalently by the C lexer.
\end{enumerate}

The emphasis here is on the representation of strings.  The reader does not always invert the printer ---
the expression $\fopen \fopen \mathtt{one~two} \fclose \;\mathtt{three}\fclose$ prints as {\tt one two three} which reads as
$\fopen \mathtt{one}\; \fopen \mathtt{two~three} \fclose \fclose$.  But the represented string is preserved.  This is fundamentally different from
most programming languages supporting symbolic computation (such as Lisp) where it is assumed that the tree structure, rather than the represented string, is fundamental
and hence that the reader should invert the printer.

The above universality properties allow one to assign semantics to universal syntax expressions based on the strings that they represent.  We can assign C
semantics to an expression by printing the expression and passing the resulting string to a C compiler.  This string-based semantics is not always
compositional with respect to the universal syntax tree structure.  However, the tree structure imposed by the reader is designed to approximate the
compositional structure of C syntax.  In most cases pattern matching on universal syntax expressions recovers substructure that is semantically compositional under C
semantics. Parentheses and semicolons can be helpful in aligning universal syntax trees with C semantics.
For languages and frameworks implemented as macro packages in MetaC one can guarantee that the universal syntax tree structure
has compositional semantics.

\subsection{Universal Expressions: cons-car-cdr}

A universal syntax expression is either an atom (a wrapper around a string),
a pair $\fopen e_1 e_2 \fclose$ where $e_1$ and $e_2$ are expressions, or a ``parenthesis expression'' the form $(e)$,
$\{ e\}$, or $[e]$ where $e$ is an expression.   All three of these datatypes have the same C type {\tt expptr} (Expression Pointer).
For each of the types atom, pair and parenthesis expression there is a constructor procedure, a predicate, and accessor functions as follows.

\begin{verbatim}
expptr string_atom(char *);
int atomp(expptr);
char * atom_string(expptr); //the argument must be an atom.

expptr cons(expptr,expptr);
int cellp(expptr);
expptr car(expptr); //the argument must be a cell. returns the first component.
expptr cdr(expptr); //the argument must be a cell. returns the second component.

expptr intern_paren(char,expptr); // the char must be one of '(', '{' or '['
int parenp(expptr);
expptr paren_inside(expptr);
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \mathtt{Hello~World} & \Rightarrow & \fopen \mathtt{Hello}\;\; \mathtt{World}\fclose \\
  \mathtt{one~two~three} & \Rightarrow & \fopen \mathtt{one}\;\; \fopen \mathtt{two} \; \;\mathtt{three}\fclose\fclose\;   = \; \fopen \mathtt{one~two~three} \fclose \\
  \mathtt{x~+~y} & \Rightarrow & \fopen\fopen \mathtt{x~+}\fclose\;\mathtt{y}\fclose \; = \; \fopen \mathtt{x~+~y} \fclose \\
  \mathtt{x+y*z} & \Rightarrow & \fopen \mathtt{x~+}\; \fopen \mathtt{y~*~z} \fclose\fclose \\
  \mathtt{(x+y)*z} & \Rightarrow & \fopen (\fopen \mathtt{x~+~y} \fclose )\;\mathtt{*~z}\fclose \\
  \mathtt{foo}(\mathtt{int~x}) & \Rightarrow & \fopen \mathtt{foo}\; (\fopen \mathtt{int}\;  \; \mathtt{x}\fclose)\fclose \\
  \mathtt{foo(int~x,~float~y)} & \Rightarrow & \fopen \mathtt{foo} \; (\fopen\fopen \mathtt{int}\; \mathtt{x} \fclose\;
  \mathtt{,}\; \fopen\mathtt{float} \; \mathtt{y} \fclose\fclose )\;\fclose \\
  \mathtt{(foo\; (int~x,~float~y)\; bar)} & \Rightarrow & (\fopen \mathtt{foo} \; (\mathtt{int}\; \mathtt{x}
  \mathtt{,}\; \mathtt{float} \; \mathtt{y})\;{\tt bar}\fclose) \\
  \mathtt{(\$\; \;f\; \backslash \;\$\;b\;c)} & \Rightarrow & (\fopen\fopen\$\; \mathtt{f}\fclose\; \fopen\fopen\backslash \;\$\fclose \;\mathtt{b}\fclose\;{\tt c}\fclose)
\end{eqnarray*}

\caption{{\bf Examples of Reader Bracketings.} Bracketings are shown for the expression that results from reading the given strings.
  A complete bracketing shows a pair of brackets for every expression
  pair (cons cell).  The second and third example show two conventions
  for dropping some of the brackets --- general sequences are assumed
  to be right-associative and binary connective applications are
  assumed to be left-associative.  These conventions are used in the
  other examples.  Expressions are printed without the brackets ---
  the brackets are ``phantoms'' that show the tree structure.
  See section~\ref{sec:reader}.}
\label{fig:reader}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Universal Expressions: Phantom Brackets}

The MetaC reader maps a character string to a universal syntax expression.  A specification of the reader is given in section~\ref{sec:reader}.
The expression produced by the reader
can be represented by ``phantom brackets'' around the given string
where there is a pair of brackets for each cons cell.
For example the expression \mtt{\{one two three\}} reads as $\{\fopen \mathtt{one}\;\fopen \mathtt{two~three}\fclose \fclose\}$.
Examples of strings and the phantom bracking imposed by the reading those strings is given in figure~{\ref{fig:reader}}.
The printer simply removes the phantom brackets and prints the string that the expression represents.

To reduce the clutter of brackets we will adopt two conventions for supressing brackets --- a list convention and a binary operator convention.
The list convention abbreviates $\fopen \mathtt{zero}\;\fopen \mathtt{one}\;\fopen \mathtt{two~three}\fclose \fclose \fclose$
as $\fopen\mathtt{zero~one~two~three}\fclose$.  The binary operation convention involves connective atoms --- atoms whose string consists entirely of
characters classified as a connectives as described in section \ref{sec:reader}.  For example, the string \mtt{\{a + b\}} reads as
$\{\fopen \fopen \mathtt{a~+} \fclose \;\mathtt{b} \fclose \}$.  We then adopt the convention of writing this as
$\{\fopen \mathtt{a~+~b} \fclose \}$.
The MetaC reader bracketing of
$$\{e_1\;;\;e_2\;;\;e_3\;;\;e_4\}$$
is $$\{\fopen \fopen e_1\;;\fclose \;\fopen \fopen e_2\;;\fclose \;\fopen \fopen e_3\;;\fclose\;e_4\fclose\fclose\fclose\}.$$
which can be abbreviated using the binary operation convention as
$$\{\fopen e_1\;;\;\fopen e_2\;;\;\fopen e_3\;;\;e_4\fclose\fclose\fclose\}$$
or abbreviated with the list convention as
$$\{\fopen \fopen e_1\;;\fclose \;\fopen e_2\;;\fclose \;\fopen e_3\;;\fclose\;e_4\fclose\}.$$




\subsection{The Reader Specification}
\label{sec:reader}

The MetaC reader can be described in three phases --- preprocessing, lexicalization, and parsing.

The MetaC preprocessor replaces each C-style comment with a space character.  When processing an entire file,
as is done in the MetaC procedure {\tt file\_expressions}
described in section~\ref{sec:bootstrap}, the preprocessor divides the file into
cells using the same conventions as is used in the emacs under mc-mode.
A file must be parenthesis-balanced within each cell.

Lexicalization segments a pre-processed character string into a sequence of atoms.
The MetaC lexer preserves all non-white characters.  For the MetaC lexer each atom is one of the following.

\begin{itemize}
\item A symbol.  A symbol is a character string consisting of only alpha-numeric characters --- upper and lower case letters of the alphabet, plus the decimal numerals, plus underbar.
  For example {\tt foo\_bar1}.
\item A connective.  A connective is a character string consisting of only ``connective characters''.
  Grouped by precedence, the connective characters are
  
  \medskip
  {\small
  \centerline{~\;\;\;\;\;\;\{\mtt{;}\} \{\mtt{,}\} \{\mtt{:}\} \{\mtt{@}\}
  \{{\tt |}\} \{{\tt \&}\} \{{\tt !}\} \{{\tt ?}\} \{{\tt =} {\tt $\sim$}, {\tt $<$}, {\tt $>$}\} \{{\tt +}, {\tt -}\}
  \{{\tt *}, {\tt /}\} \{{\tt \%}, $\hat{~}$\} \{{\tt .}, {\tt \#}\}, \{$\epsilon$\}.}
  }
  \medskip
  The characters are listed from low precedence (strongly separating, weakly binding) to high precedence (strongly binding, weakly separating). A connective
  ---a string of connective characters --- has the precedence of its first character.  The ``null connective'' $\epsilon$
  intuitively represents the space character used as a connective.  The null connective and the null argument are discussed below.
\item A quoted string.  A character string starting and ending with the same string quotation character.  For example {\tt "foo bar"}, {\tt "!:\&?;"} or {\tt 'a'}.
\item A special character atom. These are atoms whose strings are one character long where that character is one of
  the special characters $\mtt{`}$, $\mtt{\$}$, and $\backslash$.
\end{itemize}

Two strings will be called whitespace-equivalent if they lexicalize to the same sequence of atoms.

\newcommand{\sym}{\mathrm{SYM}}
\newcommand{\conn}{\mathrm{CONN}}
\newcommand{\quot}{\mathrm{QUOTE}}
\newcommand{\misc}{\mathrm{MISC}}
\newcommand{\app}{\mathrm{APP}}
\newcommand{\var}{\mathrm{VAR}}


The reader is specified by the grammar shown in figure~\ref{fig:grammar}.

\begin{figure}
  
\begin{eqnarray*}
  E & ::= & E_\infty \;|\; E_p \\
  E_\infty & ::= & A \;|\; \fopen A \; E_\infty \fclose \\
  A & ::= & \quot \;|\; \sym \;|\; P  \;|\; \fopen \; `\;A\fclose \;|\; \fopen \; \$\;A\fclose \;|\;\fopen\fopen\backslash\; B \fclose\;A \fclose \;|\; \epsilon \\
  B & ::= & \$ \;|\; \fopen \backslash\;B \fclose \;|\; \epsilon \\
  P & ::= & (E) \;|\; \{E\} \;|\; [E] \\
  E_p & ::= & \fopen \fopen  E_\ell\;\conn_p \fclose \;E_r\fclose\;\;\;\;p \in {\cal R}, \;\ell > p, \; r \geq p \\
  E_p & ::= & \fopen \fopen E_\ell\;\conn_p \fclose \;E_r\fclose\;\;\;\;p \in {\cal L}, \; \ell \geq p,\; r > p
\end{eqnarray*}

\caption{{\bf The grammar defining the MetaC reader.}
The nonterminal $\sym$ generates symbol atoms; $\conn_p$ generates connective atoms of precedence $p$; and $\quot$ generates string quotation atoms.
The reader is defined by a deterministic left-to-right shift-reduce parser
in which the $\epsilon$-productions for $A$ and $B$ are selected only when no other option is available.
The nonterminal $E_\infty$ generates arguments to the binary connectives.
The nonterminal $E_p$ generates expressions whose root connective has priority $p$ (and whose internal connectives have priority at least $p$).
${\cal R}$ is the set of right-associative precedence levels and ${\cal L}$ is the set of left-associative levels.
}
\label{fig:grammar}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Backquote and Pattern Matching Revisited}

The semantics of backquote is defined in terms of cons-car-cdr view of expressions independent of the MetaC reader.
In the typical case, the C value of a backquote expression
$\fopen ` \;\{e\}\fclose$ is the expression (tree) $e$ with subexpressions (subtrees) of the form $\fopen \$\;x \fclose$, where $x$ is a symbol,
replaced by the C value of $x$
and subexpressions (subtrees) of the form $\fopen \$\;\{w\}\fclose$ replaced by the expression which is the C value of the string represented by the expression $w$.

Unfortunately this evaluation rule for backquote expressions is incomplete.  One of the most
confusing situations is where the expansion of a macro contains a backquote.  Writing such a macro typically involves nested backquotes.  While nested backquotes
are confusing, and should be avoided when possible, MetaC supports nested backquotes.  We consider a series of backquote expressions each of which evaluates to the previous one.

First we have
\begin{equation}
\label{bq1}
`\{a+b+\$\{z\}\}
\end{equation}

If the value of variable {\tt z} is the expression {\tt c} then the value of expression (\ref{bq1}) is the expression {\tt a+b+c}.
The symbol {\tt \$} can be included in the value of a backquote expression by quoting it.  This gives our second expression.
\begin{equation}
\label{bq2}
`\{`\{a + \$\{y\} + \fopen \backslash\$\fclose\{z\}\}\}
\end{equation}

If the value of variable {\tt y} is the expression $b$ then the value expression of (\ref{bq2}) is expression (\ref{bq1}).
We can even have multiple layers of quotation as in the following.
\begin{equation}
\label{bq3}
`\{`\{`\{\$\{x\} + \fopen\backslash\$\fclose\{y\} + \fopen\backslash\backslash\$\fclose\{z\}\}\}\}
\end{equation}

If the value of variable {\tt x} is the expression {\tt a} then the value of expression (\ref{bq3}) is expression (\ref{bq2}).

As with backquote, pattern matching is defined in terms of the cons-car-cdr view of expressions independent of the MetaC reader.  We define a substitution to be a mapping from
symbol atoms to expressions. For a substitution $\sigma$ and a pattern $\{e\}$ we define the expression $\sigma(e)$
to be the result of replacing each subexpression (subtree) of $e$ of the form $\fopen \$\;x \fclose$ where $x$ is a symbol atom with $\sigma(x)$.  A pattern expression (tree) $\{e\}$ matches an expression (tree) $w$ with substitution $\sigma$
if $\sigma(e) = w$. An exception to this is the case where a variable occurs multiple times in the pattern.  In release 1.0 multiple occurrences of a variable in a pattern is not supported.

\section{List of MetaC Primitives}

We now give a list of the MetaC primitives and pre-installed type definitions.  The macros backquote, ucase, and umacro expand to code built on these primitives.
We start with type definitions needed for the single atom type restriction needed for the limiting type parsing abilities of MetaC.

\begin{verbatim}
typedef char * charptr;
typedef void * voidptr;
typedef FILE * FILEptr;
typedef struct expstruct{...} * expptr;
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Expressions}

The macros {\tt backquote} and {\tt ucase} expand into C code using these procedures.

\begin{verbatim}
expptr string_atom(charptr s);

int atomp(expptr e);

charptr atom_string(expptr a);

expptr cons(expptr x, expptr y);

int cellp(expptr e);

expptr car(expptr x);

expptr cdr(expptr x);

expptr intern_paren(char openchar, expptr arg); \\ openchar must be one of '(', '{' or '['.

int parenp(expptr e);

expptr paren_inside(expptr e);

char constructor(expptr e); //used for paren expressions.
\end{verbatim}

We also have integer-expression conversions.

\begin{verbatim}
expptr int_exp(int i);

int exp_int(expptr s);
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Properties}

The macro {\tt umacro} expands to code that
sets the macro property of some atom to a procedure pointer.

\begin{verbatim}
void setprop(expptr e, expptr key, voidptr val);

expptr getprop(expptr e, expptr key, expptr defaultval);

expptr gensym(charptr s);
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Errors and Breakpoints}

\begin{verbatim}
void berror(charptr s);

void breakpt(charptr s);

void NIDE();
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Reading and Printing}
The procedure {\tt file\_expressions} takes a file name and returns a
list of the expressions (in universal syntax) contained in the cells
of the file.  The procedures {\tt pprint} and {\tt mcpprint} and the macro {\tt mcprint} print to the emacs *Messages* buffer in
emacs.

\begin{verbatim}
expptr file_expressions(charptr name);

void pprint(expptr e, FILEptr f, int indent); //indent is typically 0

void mcpprint(expptr e);

void mcprint(...)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Macro Expansion}

\begin{verbatim}
expptr macroexpand(expptr e);

expptr macroexpand1(expptr e); //this result may contain unexpanded macros

void add_init_form(expptr statement);

void add_preamble(expptr aux_definition);
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{List Processing}

In Lisp lists are terminated with the special value {\tt nil}.  In MetaC lists any atom in the
cdr of a cell is treated as {\tt nil}.

\begin{verbatim}
expptr nil();

expptr append(expptr l1, expptr l2);

expptr reverse(expptr l);

typedef  expptr exp_to_exp(expptr);
typedef  void exp_to_void(expptr);

expptr mapcar(exp_to_exp f, expptr l);

void mapc(exp_to_void f, expptr l);

int length(expptr l);
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Memory Frames}

\begin{verbatim}
in_memory_frame(<statement>)

voidptr stack_alloc(int nbytes);
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Undo Frames}

\begin{verbatim}
void exp_from_undo_frame(<expression>);

voidptr undo_alloc(int nbytes);

void undo_set(voidptr loc, voidptr val);

void clean_undo_frame(expptr e);
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Bootstrapping and File Expansion}

\begin{verbatim}
file_expressions(char * fname);

mcexpand(char * fname1, char * fname2);

init_fun(fname)
\end{verbatim}
